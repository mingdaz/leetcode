#247. Strobogrammatic Number II (M)
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.

For example,
Given n = 2, return ```["11","69","88","96"]```.

Hint:

Try to use recursion and notice that it should recurse with n - 2 instead of n - 1.
