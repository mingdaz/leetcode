Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open `(` and closing parentheses `)`, the plus `+` or minus sign `-`, non-negative integers and empty spaces  <code> </code>.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:
```
"1 + 1" = 2
" 2-1 + 2 " = 3
"(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)" = 23
```
Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.
