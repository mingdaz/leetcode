Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and empty spaces <code> </code>. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:
```
"3+2*2" = 7
" 3/2 " = 1
" 3+5 / 2 " = 5
```
Note: Do not use the `eval` built-in library function.

Credits:
Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

Solution: The key is to seperate the expression by `+` and `-`. Each time we find a `+` or `-`, we sum up the result of the substring prior to that operator.
