Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:
Given the list `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`,

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

Example 2:
Given the list `[1,[4,[6]]]`,

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].

Pure interator solution:
{% highlight c++ %}
{% include leet341/leet341_1.cpp %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
{% include 341.flatten-nested-list-iterator.java %}
{% endhighlight %}
