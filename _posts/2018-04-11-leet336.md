Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices `(i, j)` in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. `words[i] + words[j]` is a palindrome.

Example 1:<br />
Given `words` = `["bat", "tab", "cat"]`<br />	
Return `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`<br />
The palindromes are `["battab", "tabbat"]`<br />
Example 2:<br />
Given words = `["abcd", "dcba", "lls", "s", "sssll"]`<br />
Return `[[0, 1], [1, 0], [3, 2], [2, 4]]`<br />
The palindromes are `["dcbaabcd", "abcddcba", "slls", "llssssll"]`<br />

The time complexity would be O(nk^2). Suppose n is the size of words, and k is the size of average words' length.
