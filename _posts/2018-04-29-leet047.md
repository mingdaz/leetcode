<div><p>Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [1,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong>
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]
</pre>
</div>

Solution1: Backtracking, this time passing by value not reference.  
Solution2: Generating lexicographic order  
1. Sorting to ascending order. 
2. Find the first element from back which is smaller than its next element. Suppose the index is `k` 
If we could not find such elements, it means that the array is in decreasing order.   
We have finished generating all permutations.
3. Now from the back find the first element which is bigger than element `k`. Suppose it is `l`. This step is to prevent duplicate. 
Since there might be several element has the same value until we find `k`. And we want to swap `k` with the first element bigger than it.
Then after swap the subsequence from k+1 to tail is descending order. 
4. Swap element `k` and element `l`.
5. Reverse from element k+1 to tail. Make the subsequence increasing order.
