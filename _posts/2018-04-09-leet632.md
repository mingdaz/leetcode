You have ```k``` lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the ```k``` lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if ```b-a < d-c``` or ```a < c``` if ```b-a == d-c```.

Example 1:
```
Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
```
Note:
The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
1 <= ```k``` <= 3500
-105 <= ```value of elements``` <= 105.
For Java users, please note that the input type has been changed to List<List<Integer>>. And after you reset the code template, you'll see this point.

Solution:
The idea is using a min_heap to keep track of the lower bound of the range. In order to use as small as possible extra space we use pair of ```vector<int>::interator```. Then we don't need to keep track the index i,j for ```nums[i][j]```. We could use ```*pair.first``` to get the value. And terminate by condition ```pair.first==pair.second``` which means ```vector<int>::iterator == nums[i].end()```
