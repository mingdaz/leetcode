Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
For example, given candidate set `[2, 3, 6, 7]` and target `7`, 
A solution set is: 
```
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
```
