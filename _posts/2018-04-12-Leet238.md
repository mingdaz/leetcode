Given an array of n integers where n > 1, `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Solve it without division and in `O(n)`.

For example, given `[1,2,3,4]`, return `[24,12,8,6]`.

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Solution: Two way scan. From left to right get the production of elements on the left. From right to left get the production of elements on the right. At the same time we have the final result.
