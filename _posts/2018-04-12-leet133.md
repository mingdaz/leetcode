Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` and a list of its `neighbors`.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:
```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

Solution:
Using Hash_map help record nodes that has been visited. We have an assumption that the label is unique. Then using DFS to iterator throught the graph.
