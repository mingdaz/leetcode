Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

For example,
Given `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` and k = 2, return 5.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

Special thanks to @mithmatt for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

Solution1: Min heap keep K largest elements. 
{% highlight c++ %}
{% include leet215/leet215_1.cpp %}
{% endhighlight %}

Solution2: QuickSort when pivot is K then sovlved.
{% highlight c++ %}
{% include leet215/leet215_2.cpp %}
{% endhighlight %}
