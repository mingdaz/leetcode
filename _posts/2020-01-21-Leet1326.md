Two solutions:
# Greedy
Classic greedy problem. Calculate the minimum number of segments `[Lx, Rx]` which could cover a segment `[X, Y]`.
1. Sort segemnt by `Lx` 
2. Select `L_i <= X` and `R_i > X` where `R_i` is maximum.
3. Keep selecting next segement which `L_i+1 <= R_i` and `R_i+1 > R_i` where `R_i+1` is maximum. Until `R_i+1 >= Y`

# Dynamic Programming
This question could be transfered to Jump Game problem. Create a new array `A`, `A[i]` represent the farest distance can go from this position `i`. 
1. `A[Math.max(0,i-water[i])] = Math.max(A[Math.max(0,i-water[i])], i+water[i])`
2. Solve Jump game using DP.
