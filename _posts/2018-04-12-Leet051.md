The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/8-queens.png)

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:
```
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

Solution: Normal backtracking solution. One trick could be applied here is that we could use single integer to substitute the `vector<int>` flags by bit operation. The imporved version is
