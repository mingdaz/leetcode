Using Dynamic Programming. 

### Solution 1
we abstract the status as `f(i,j,k)`. Where `i` is the current position of the string. `j` is one finger's position. And `k` is another finger's position(character - `'A'`). And not all nodes are reachable. `j` and `k` at least one of them should be the same as the current character in the string. <br>
Initially we have:<br>
`f(1,s[0]- 'A',k) = 0 (k=0..25)`<br>
`f(1,j,s[0]- 'A') = 0 (j=0..25)`<br>
Then the state transform equation:<br>
`f(i+1, s[i] - 'A', k) = min{f(i, j, k) + dis(j, s[i]-'A') | j=0..25 and f(i, j, k) is reachable }`<br>
`f(i+1, j, s[i] - 'A') = min{f(i, j, k) + dis(k, s[i]-'A') | k=0..25 and f(i, j, k) is reachable }`<br>
The answer is the minimum of follow items<br>
`min{f(n, s[n-1] - 'A', k) | k=0..25 }`<br>
`min{f(n, j, s[n-1] - 'A') | j=0..25 }`<br>

### Solution 2
Since one of the finger should be the same as current character. Therefore we could reduce one dimension. And we do not care the order of the two finger at current status. We only need to know the position. So we have `f(i,j)` where `j > i` and `i={0..n-1}, j={1..n}`.
Initially we have:<br>
`f(0,1) = 0`<br>
`f(1,2) = 0`<br>
Then the state transform equation:<br>
`f(0,j+1) = f(0,j) + dis(s[j], s[j-1]) | j={1..n-1}`<br>
`f(i,i+1) = min{f(t,i) + dis(s[t],s[i+1]) | t={0..i-1}} where i={1..n-1}`<br> 
`f(i,j+1) = f(i,j) + dis(s[j],s[j+1]) where j={i..n-1}`<br>
The answer is the minimum of follow items<br>
`min{f(i,n) | k=0..n-1 }`<br>
