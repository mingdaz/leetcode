Using Dynamic Programming. First method we abstract the status as `f(i,j,k)`. Where `i` is the current position of the string. `j` is one finger's position. And `k` is another finger's position(character - `'A'`). And not all nodes are reachable. `j` and `k` at least one of them should be the same as the current character in the string. <br>
Initially we have:<br>
`f(1,s[0]- 'A',k) = 0 (k=0..25)`<br>
`f(1,j,s[0]- 'A') = 0 (j=0..25)`<br>
Then the state transform equation:<br>
`f(i+1, s[i] - 'A', k) = min{f(i, j, k) + dis(j, s[i]-'A') | j=0..25 and f(i, j, k) is reachable }`<br>
`f(i+1, j, s[i] - 'A') = min{f(i, j, k) + dis(k, s[i]-'A') | k=0..25 and f(i, j, k) is reachable }`<br>
The answer is the minimum of follow items<br>
`min{f(n, s[n-1] - 'A', k) | k=0..25 }`<br>
`min{f(n, j, s[n-1] - 'A') | j=0..25 }`<br>
