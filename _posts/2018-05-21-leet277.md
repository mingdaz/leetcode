<div class="question-description__2cX5"><div><p>
Suppose you are at a party with <code>n</code> people (labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other <code>n - 1</code> people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
</p>

<p>
Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
</p>

<p>
You are given a helper function <code>bool knows(a, b)</code> which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function <code>int findCelebrity(n)</code>, your function should minimize the number of calls to <code>knows</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return <code>-1</code>.
</p></div></div>

Solution1: Brute force O(n^2)
{% highlight c++ %}
{% include leet277/leet277_2.cpp %}
{% endhighlight %}

Solution2: O(n) solution. First pass select candidate. Since there could be only one celebrity or no. Starting from `k=0`. If `knows(k,i+1)` then update `k` to `i+1`. Otherwise `i+1` could not be a candidate. Second pass double check if `k` is celebrity or not.
