<div class="question-description"><div><p>
There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. 
However, the order among letters are unknown to you. 
You receive a list of <b>non-empty</b> words from the dictionary, where <b>words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language</b>.
Derive the order of letters in this language.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 1:</b><br>
Given the following words in dictionary,
</p><pre>[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
The correct order is: <code>"wertf"</code>.</p>

<p>
<b>Example 2:</b><br>
Given the following words in dictionary,
</p><pre>[
  "z",
  "x"
]
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
The correct order is: <code>"zx"</code>.</p>

<p>
<b>Example 3:</b><br>
Given the following words in dictionary,
</p><pre>[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
The order is invalid, so return <code>""</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
</p><ol>
<li>You may assume all letters are in lowercase.</li>
<li>You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.</li>
<li>If the order is invalid, return an empty string.</li>
<li>There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.</li>
</ol>
