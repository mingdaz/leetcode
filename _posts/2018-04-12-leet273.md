Convert a non-negative integer to its english words representation. Given input is guaranteed to be less than 2^31 - 1.

For example,
```
123 -> "One Hundred Twenty Three"
12345 -> "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
1234567 -> "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
```

Solution: The solution should not limit to this number range. It is easy to scale for larger cases.
