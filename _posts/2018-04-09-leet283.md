Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`, after calling your function, nums should be `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`.

Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
