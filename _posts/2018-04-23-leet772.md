Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators , open `(` and closing parentheses `)` and empty spaces <code> </code>. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2147483648, 2147483647].

Some examples:
```
"1 + 1" = 2
" 6-4 / 2 " = 4
"2*(5+5*2)/3+(6/2+8)" = 21
"(2+6* 3+5- (3*14/7+2)*5)+3"=-12
```
Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.

Solution: Combine the idea from I and II. Use a stack to store `cur`, `res` and `op`.
