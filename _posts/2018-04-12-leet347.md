Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

For example,
Given `[1,1,1,2,2,3]` and k = 2, return `[1,2]`.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

Solution:
Using an hash_map to count the number of each unique values. Then using a prority queue as a min_heap with size limited to K. A trick here is to let the cnt number be negative. So that I don't need to pass in comparator.
